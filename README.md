# MDSN-WCE

## The PyTorch code for our paper "Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Diagnosis Using Prototype Self-Attention and Dynamic Curriculum Learning," IEEE TASE 2025.

With the manuscript and code reviews successfully completed, the full code is now available in this repository.

## Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Upload zip-compressed datasets to the data directory and unzip them.
2. Use data_split.ipynb in the data directory to automatically divide into the training-validation-test.
3. Use mean_std_classweight.ipynb in the capsule_model directory to obtain the mean and std of the dataset, and the weights needed for weighted cross-entropy.
4. After confirming the parameters, run the .py code for the corresponding dataset in the capsule_model directory, where the dataset name is specified.
5. The log files of the learning process are output to the terminal and to the log folder, and the trained models are saved to the model folder, both under the capsule_model directory.
6. You can load the trained model using plot_cm, plot_heatmap, plot_tSNE_{dataset_name} to plot confusion matrix, heatmap, tSNE representation visualization, respectively.
